This purpose of this project is to investigate GRB prompt emission by using theoretical descriptions of the acceleration mechanisms and emission processes occurring within the jet to simulate the internal and external jet dynamics in order to calculate the emitted spectra and light curves.

There is a manual that outlines how to use the simulation code and plotting functions located at writeups/code-manual/code-manual.pdf

Directory Descriptions:
c-scripts/ -- contains all files for simulations (a description of how to use the code is below)
instr-files/ -- useful instrument response matrix files are be stored here  
writeups/ -- various write-ups and derivations are stored here


Code Description:
main.cpp -- The desired simulation and outputs can be obtained by editing and running main.cpp
SynthGRB.cpp -- Main script for simulating jet dynamics and spectra/light curve generation methods
ObsGRB.cpp -- Main script to handle observed GRB data
DataAnalysis.cpp -- Main for data analysis between simulated and observed GRBs 

cosmology.cpp -- Defines useful cosmological constants
utilfuncs.cpp -- Defines useful common utility functions used by many scripts throughout the code

ShellDist.cpp -- Contains the definition of the class object and respective methods for ShellDistribtuon (used by SynthGRB.cpp)
Spectrum.cpp -- Contains the definition of the class object and respective methods for Spectra
