This purpose of this project is to investigate GRB prompt emission by simulating internal jet dynamics and calculating the emitted spectrum using theoretical descriptions of the acceleration mechanisms and emission processes occurring within the jet.

Directory Descriptions:
sim_results/ -- contains the most recent results produced by a prompt jet simulation
writeups/ -- useful write-ups and derivations are stored here

Script Descriptions:
main.py -- used to initiate a prompt jet class instance and simulate its evolution. 
promptjet.py -- defines the prompt jet class and defines the physics of the evolution
shelldists.py -- defines various Lorentz distributions for the shells in a prompt jet. 
emission.py -- contains relevant functions for constructing the spectra and light curves produced by  prompt jet simulation
makeplots.py -- script to create all plots specified by the user. The plots are created from the data files most recently stored in sim_results/
utils.py -- contains various functions useful for several scripts
cosmologicalconstants.py -- contains all established constants (e.g., speed of light) is cgs units. Acts as global variable space.
